    <h1>Node.js</h1>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any
        kind of project!   </p>
    <p>Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to
        be very performant.    </p>
    <p>A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set
        of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally,
        libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather
        than the norm.    </p>
    <p>When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem,
        instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the
        response comes back.    </p>
    <p>This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the
        burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.
    </p>
